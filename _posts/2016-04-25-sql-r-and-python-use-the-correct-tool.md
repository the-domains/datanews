According to this post (http://www.dataiku.com/blog/2016/02/25/why-data-wrangling-in-only-code-is-inefficient.html), data scientists spend 50 to 80% of their time cleaning data. 

This is only one of the steps. The macro process involves to define the final goal, to collect data, to explore data, clean the data, build a model and, finally, put the model in production.

After all, "if you only have a you tend to see every problem as a nail" (--Abraham Maslow).
